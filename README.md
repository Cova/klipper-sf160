# Automated Klipper Config Backup

![header](.images/SaladFork.jpg)

### Fabreeko HoneyBadger SF160 : VT.775 : SF.008

Welcome to the online public backup of my printer configuration. The scripts, macros, and configuration files you will find here are an assorted collection of bits I've found over many years, and a few little pieces of my own creation, all mashed together to make my printer run the way I like it to.

Disclaimer: Do **NOT** blindly copy code from the internet into your own printer's config - there is a high possibility of things not working or something being damaged.  I keep this backup folder as complete as possible to benefit myself (it is my backup after all), where many repo's exclude things like saved_variables.  I make it public to benefit everyone else *as a reference only*.  Learn from it, use pieces of it - but don't come complaining if eg. something in my custom Z-offset handling put a scratch in your PEI.  Everything you find here you use at your own risk.
